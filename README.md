# Viewput.io
Horrible name for a beautiful app. Allows users to ditch the browser and view their videos in a better UI.

## Installing
No binary distributions will be created until a stable v 1.0.0 release.

## Running
To run the developer version, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies. Assuming you have electron installed, `cd PATH/TO/CLONED/REPO` and run `electron .`

## Roadmap
Below is a non comprehensive set of goals I have created for myself. I will work on them individually, the first couple will be the part of version 1.0.0.

* Add basic file viewing [CURRENT]
* Improve video binge watching
* Add protocol capturing to capture links so users can fetch files easily
* Allow for downloading of files with pause/resume functionality
* Fix horrible zipping mechanisms of the original app by adding alternative batch download functionality

## Contributing
Fork the repository and feel free to send me pull requests. If you have version breaking changes, please make an issue first and let me know what you are planning to do. I might be able to accommodate such change.
